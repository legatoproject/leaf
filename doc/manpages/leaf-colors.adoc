== NAME

leaf-colors - customize and update the leaf color themes

== DESCRIPTION

This page explains how to customize the output of the *leaf* commands to better
display the colors that work with your terminal.

== Configuration file

The colors configuration reads the colors from the *themes.ini* configuration file. *themes.ini* is
located in the *leaf* configuration folder (see *leaf config* documentation).

== Themes

Colors are grouped by "themes". The purpose of a theme is to set a collection of colors, and then
switch from a colors collection to another by simply changing the active theme by selecting the active one
in the *themes.ini* configuration file.

In the configuration file, themes are identified by its header (*[NAME]*) and a list of
_property = values_ . It is possible to have multiple values defined for one property (see example).

Leaf includes a *[DEAULT]* theme which configures the default color behavior of Leaf. You can either tweak the *DEFAULT* theme or create a new theme.

To switch from the default theme set the environment variable *LEAF_THEME* to the new theme name. i.e., *export LEAF_THEME=DARK*
