"The right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the
 Constitution against State action includes both the right to speak
 freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all, except in so far
 as essential operations of government may require it for the
 preservation of an orderly society,---as in the case of compulsion to
 give evidence in court."
    -- Justice Murphy, in concurrance, West Virginia State Board of
       Education v. Barnette 319 U.S. 624 No. 591
